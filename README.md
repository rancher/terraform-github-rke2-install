# Terraform RKE2 Install

WARNING! this module is experimental

This module installs RKE2 from files on the local workstation or on a remote server.
If the contents of your config change, this module will attempt to install the new config and restart the service.

## Release

This is the version of rke2 to install, even when supplying the files it is necessary to specify the exact version of rke2 you are installing.

- If the release version changes, this module will attempt to run the installation again.

## RKE2 Config

If not supplying your own files you may provide the string (utf8) contents of your rke2 config using the `rke2_config` variable.
If the value of this variable changes, then the module will copy the new config to the remote server and restart the process.
This allows you to manage your config iteratively and separately from this module.

You may also provide any number of `*.yaml ` files in the local directory specified in `local_file_path` variable,
these files will be copied to the remote server and moved into a yaml.d directory which rke2 will pick up and read during install. If the contents of any files change, then this module will detect the change, copy the new config to the remote server, and restart the process.
This allows you to manage your config iteratively and separately from this module.

## Examples

The examples directory serves two purposes; to give example implementations of this module, and to provide use cases for the tests.
All examples are tested using Terratest, you can find them in the ./tests directory.
Examples may seem redundant to some extent, they are meant to be viewed and tested independently and concurrently.

### Local State

The specific use case for the example modules is temporary infrastructure for testing purposes.
With that in mind, it is not expected that we manage the resources as a team, therefore the state files are all stored locally.
If you would like to store the state files remotely, add a terraform backend file (`*.name.tfbackend`) to your implementation module.

## Development and Testing

### Paradigms and Expectations

Please make sure to read [terraform.md](./terraform.md) to understand the paradigms and expectations that this module has for development.

### Environment

It is important to us that all collaborators have the ability to develop in similar environments, so we use tools which enable this as much as possible.
These tools are not necessary, but they can make it much simpler to collaborate.

* I use [nix](https://nixos.org/) that I have installed using [their recommended script](https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-install-macos)
* I use [direnv](https://direnv.net/) that I have installed using brew.
* I simply use `direnv allow` to enter the environment
* I navigate to the `tests` directory and run `go test -v -timeout=5m -parallel=10`
* To run an individual test I navigate to the `tests` directory and run `go test -v -timeout=5m -run <test function name>`
  * eg. `go test -v -timeout=5m -run TestBasic`
* I use `override.tf` files to change the values of `examples` to personalized data so that I can run them.
* I store my GitHub credentials in a local file and generate a symlink to them named `~/.config/github/default/rc`
  * this will be automatically sourced when you enter the nix environment (and unloaded when you leave)

Our continuous integration tests in the GitHub [ubuntu-latest runner](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/linux/Ubuntu2204-Readme.md), which has many different things installed
